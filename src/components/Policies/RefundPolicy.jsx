        <p className="mb-4">
          We have a 7-day "replace or refund" policy, which means you have 7 days after receiving your item to request a replacement or refund. A replacement or refund is only offered in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>The item received is damaged on reaching your location.</li>
          <li>The item has a prior defect.</li>
          <li>The wrong item has been shipped to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us within 7 days if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
        </p>

          You can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@housenama.com" className="text-blue-600 underline">help@housenama.com</a> with pictures of the product. Also, let us know if you'd like a replacement or refund. Once approved, youâ€™ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we do not offer replacements or refunds in cases where you have made a spelling mistake in the content of the nameplate. In cases where a replacement is requested with minor changes in the text, you can request the team to send a replacement at a discounted rate.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The 1-Hour Cancellation Window</h2>
        <p>
          We have a 1-hour cancellation window, which means that any requests for cancellation must be made within 1 hour of placing the order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the 1-hour mark lapses, we process your order and add it to the design and production queue. Hence, any request for cancellation made after it is processed cannot be entertained.
